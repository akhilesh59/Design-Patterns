Suppose we are building a coffee shop application where customers can order different types of coffee.
Each coffee can have various optional add-ons such as milk, sugar, whipped cream, etc.
We want to implement a system where we can dynamically add these add-ons to a coffee order without
modifying the coffee classes themselves.
