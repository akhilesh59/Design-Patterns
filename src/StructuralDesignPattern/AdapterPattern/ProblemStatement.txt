Suppose we have an application that needs to send email notifications to the concerned users.
Currently, we are using our in-house "EmailNotificationService", but now we want to use service like "SendGrid".
However, the interface for out in-house system and the SendGrid service are incompatible.

Solve this problem using Adapter pattern.
