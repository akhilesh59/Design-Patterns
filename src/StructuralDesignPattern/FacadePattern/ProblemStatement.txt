Problem Statement 1:
Implement a API Gateway service by using which the Client can connect with different Microservices.


Problem Statement 2:
Letâ€™s consider a hotel. This hotel has a hotel keeper. There are a lot of restaurants inside the hotel
e.g. Veg restaurants, Non-Veg restaurants, and Veg/Non Both restaurants.
You, as a client want access to different menus of different restaurants.

- You do not know what are the different menus they have. You just have access to a hotel keeper who knows his hotel well.
- Whichever menu you want, you tell the hotel keeper and he takes it out of the respective restaurants and hands
  it over to you.
