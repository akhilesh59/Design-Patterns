Imagine a graphical user interface (GUI) application where multiple icons of different types
(e.g., file icons, folder icons) need to be displayed on a screen. Each icon type has a specific appearance
and behavior, such as different images and positions on the screen. However, displaying numerous icons of the
same type can consume significant memory if each icon object stores its unique properties independently.
